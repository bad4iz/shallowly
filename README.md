# Shallowly 🏝️

The Modern Shallow Renderer for React 18+ Testing

**The modern Enzyme alternative** for fast unit testing with:  
✅ Full React 18+ support (Hooks, Context, Suspense)  
🚀 2x faster than Enzyme  
🔍 Built-in debug with `.textWithProps()`  
📦 5KB size (3x smaller than Enzyme)  
🛠 Familiar API - easy migration from Enzyme
🚀 Why Shallowly?

Enzyme is deprecated, and React Testing Library doesn't support shallow rendering. Shallowly solves this with:

✔ Future-proof - Full support for React 18+ (Hooks, Context, Suspense)
✔ Blazing fast - 2x quicker render cycles than Enzyme (benchmarks)
✔ Familiar API - Enzyme-like syntax for painless migration
✔ Debug-friendly - .textWithProps() reveals your component structure
✔ Tiny footprint - 5KB (gzipped), zero dependencies

```bash
npm install shallowly

# or

yarn add shallowly
```

✨ Key Features

1. React 18+ Ready
   Test modern features without workarounds:

```jsx
shallow(
  <Suspense fallback={<Loader />}>
    <AsyncComponent />
  </Suspense>,
);
```

2. Enzyme Compatibility Layer

```dif
- import { shallow } from 'enzyme';

* import { shallow } from 'shallowly'; // Same API!
```

3. Visual Debugging

   ```jsx
   console.log(wrapper.textWithProps());
   // Outputs:
   // <DataFetching isLoading={true}>
   // <Spinner />
   // </DataFetching>
   ```

4. TypeScript Native
   ```tsx
   const wrapper = shallow<Props>(<User id={123} />);
   wrapper.prop("id"); // Type-safe: number
   ```
   📦 Quick Start
   Install:

```bash
npm install shallowly --save-dev
```

Write tests:

```jsx
Copy;
import { shallow } from "shallowly";

test("shows loading state", () => {
  const wrapper = shallow(<DataFetcher isLoading={true} />);
  expect(wrapper.find("Spinner").exists()).toBe(true);
});
```
